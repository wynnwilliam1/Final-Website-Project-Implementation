            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Apple has made a significant impact in the gaming space, primarily through its App Store, which has become a major platform for mobile gaming, hosting a vast array of casual, indie, and AAA games. With the introduction of Apple Arcade, a subscription-based gaming service, Apple expanded its commitment to gaming by offering an ad-free experience and exclusive titles. Additionally, the performance of Apple’s devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Silicon Macs, has positioned the company as a leader in mobile and casual gaming.</p>

        <h2>Parental Controls</h2>
        <p>
          Apple devices provide robust parental control features through Screen Time and Family Sharing. These controls allow parents to manage what their children can access on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Features include the ability to block adult websites, restrict access to certain apps, and control in-app purchases. Parents can also set daily app usage limits, schedule downtime to reduce screen time, and limit communication to specific contacts. To set up parental controls, navigate to the Screen Time settings and enable it. Choose "This is My Child’s [device]" and activate Content & Privacy Restrictions to block explicit content and manage app permissions. From there, you can customize Downtime schedules and set App Limits for individual apps or categories. Family Sharing can also be used to share approved apps and content across Apple devices. Be sure to check out the links below for more information from Apple, and be sure to sign up for the newsletter!
